    "## 1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modularity:** Classes allow you to group related data and functions together, providing a clear and modular structure to code. This promotes reusability, maintainability, and easier collaboration among developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation:** OOP encapsulates data and methods within objects, hiding the internal details and providing a well-defined interface. Encapsulation enhances data security, allows for controlled access to object internals, and simplifies code maintenance and refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction:** OOP emphasizes the creation of abstract representations of real-world objects or concepts. By abstracting away irrelevant details, developers can focus on essential characteristics and behaviors, making the system more understandable and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance:** OOP supports inheritance, which enables the creation of new classes (derived or child classes) by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes (base or parent classes). Inheritance facilitates code reuse, promotes a hierarchical organization of objects, and allows for specialization and generalization of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism:** OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably through a common interface. Polymorphism enables the use of generic code that can operate on different objects, providing flexibility and extensibility."
